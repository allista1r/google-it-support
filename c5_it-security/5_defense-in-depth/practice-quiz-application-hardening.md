## Application Hardening

<br>

### Question 1

Why is it important to keep software up-to-date?

* **To address any security vulnerabilities discovered**
* To ensure compatibility with other systems
* It's not important. It's just annoying.
* To ensure access to the latest features

> As vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed by the software vendor, applying these updates is super important to protect yourself against attackers.

### Question 2

What are some types of software that you'd want to have an explicit application policy for? Check all that apply.

* Software development kits
* **Video games**
* **Filesharing software**
* Word processors

> Video games and filesharing software typically don't have a use in business (though it does depend on the nature of the business). So, it might make sense to have explicit policies dictating whether or not this type of software is permitted on systems.

Question 3
What does applying software patches protect against? 
### Undiscovered vulnerabilities & newly found vulnerabilities
MITM attacks 
Suspicious network traffic.
Data tampering 
### Correct
> Software updates or patches can fix recently discovered vulnerabilities or close ones that you weren't aware of.

### Question 4

What should be considered when implementing software policies and guidelines?

The companyâ€™s technical debt
### What the users need in order to do their jobs
The local weather forecast
Your reputation within the company
### Correct
> If there's a common use case for a certain type of software, it would be helpful to select a specific software implementation and require the use of that solution.

### Question 5

What is one way to check whether or not a website can be trusted?
The webpage design
The company logo
### Check for SSL certificates
The quality of pictures on the website

### Correct
> Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates are issued by trusted certificate authorities (CA), such as DigiCert. An SSL certificate indicates that any data submitted through a website will be encrypted.
